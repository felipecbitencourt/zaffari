        "question": "A customer calls asking if the Downtown store is open on tomorrow's holiday. You don't know this information by heart. What is the most agile and safe procedure?",
        "opt_a": "A) Ask quickly in the team's WhatsApp group to see if anyone knows.",
        "feedback_wrong_a": "Asking in the WhatsApp group may bring outdated or wrong information. The official source is always the Intranet.",
        "opt_b": "B) Consult the Intranet under 'Branches' > 'Registration data and schedules' to have the official information.",
        "opt_c": "C) Search on Google Maps, because it is always updated there.",
        "feedback_wrong_c": "Google Maps is not always updated with special holiday hours. The Intranet is the company's only official source.",
        "opt_d": "D) Inform that it will probably be closed, to avoid the customer making a wasted trip.",
        "feedback_wrong_d": "Giving information without certainty can cause frustration to the customer. Never 'assume' answers - consult the official source.",
        "feedback": "<strong>Correct Answer!</strong> The Intranet is the only official and reliable source for branch schedules."
